# DSP-Stuff effects (gpl)

Some of the effects I'm interested in have GPL licensed implementations, as the
main project is MIT licensed, the effects that need to be GPL licensed are
located here. The main project optionally depends on this crate and therefore
all licensing should be ok? (I hope)


## Effects in here, and their original implementations
